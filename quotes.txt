"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." – Linus Torvalds
"Premature optimization is the root of all evil." – Donald Knuth
"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." – Cory House
"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." – Harold Abelson
"Simplicity is the soul of efficiency." – Austin Freeman
"Deleted code is debugged code." – Jeff Sickel
"Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming." – Brian Kernighan
"Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen." – Edward V. Berard
"Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable." – Ralph Johnson
"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." – Martin Fowler
"Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight." – Bill Gates
"The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language." – Alan Kay
"If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." – Edsger W. Dijkstra
"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they’re not." – Yogi Berra
"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." – Phil Karlton
"Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out." – Chris Pine
"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." – John Johnson
"Good code is its own best documentation." – Steve McConnell
"Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday’s code." – Dan Salomon
"Software is like entropy: It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases." – Norman Augustine
"Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it." – Brian Kernighan
"The function of good software is to make the complex appear simple." – Grady Booch
"Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file." – Louis Srygley
"Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen." – Edward V. Berard
"The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before." – Bill Gates
"Programming can be fun, so can cryptography; however, they should not be combined." – Kreitzberg and Shneiderman
"Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program." – Linus Torvalds
"To iterate is human, to recurse divine." – L. Peter Deutsch
"Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do." – Donald Knuth
"Truth can only be found in one place: the code." – Robert C. Martin
